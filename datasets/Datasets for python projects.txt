
EU_countries dataset is a dataset containing different metrics of eu member states. Part of the project was to create a group by function
without using the pandas library and plot the given data in a pie chart (yes pie charts are awful but that was part of the project
and had i been allowed to i would have plotted it as a bar cahrt :) )

heatrowdata.csv is a file I was given to work with and the first thing you will notice is that... well... it isnt a propper csv file!
Whomever created this abomination of data formatting made life dificult but it was an interesting problem as sometimes you are given data 
that isnt in the correct format and you have to convert it to a much more usable format. Which in this case means making it an actual csv
file!
