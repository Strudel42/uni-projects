# uni-projects
Projects I did at university. Some of the code could obviously be improved but I kept it the same just for a learning experience.

This project is a WIP so I will update this readme periodically as I add files.

This project is mainly for demostration purposes of what projects I enjoyed working on. 

In the python code file you will find some projects that i worked on in university. These projects include simple data manipulation tasks (without the pandas library, a restriction of the project for some reason) a basic machine learning example using scipy optimize for custom curve fitting to a dataset and also my TnesorFlow projects for my dissertation. This disssertation is a report from the ground up on machine learning  from 0 to cnovolutional neural networks focusing on computer vision tasks.

In the R code section are just a few examples of some of the more substantive projects that I could find. There is also an associated reeport with the analysis of the ILPD dataset available if you care to look at that.

Most other R projects I did are really more focused on pure statiscal work (theory) rather than a report based analysis of datasets e.g performing various sorts of analysis on the iris dataset like clustering and so on.
